# Animal Image Prediction

This animal image prediction model uses convolutional neural nets, a deep learning technique that combines both machine learning and AI, to predict whether a given animal image is either a cat, dog, or wildlife animal.

Grabbing various animal images on google images using google images api, I tested each image to see how accurate the image prediction model was.
